# Project Description

The *Statistical Analysis and Applications* course has introduced you to the methods and procedures that allow us to explore data and make statistical inferences. This Final Project is designed to demonstrate your understanding of the connections between these themes as you carry out a statistical study.

## Project Objectives and Skills

### Research Question

Identify a question that is interesting, appropriate, and worthy of investigation. Your question must lend itself to data that can be analyzed using the methods learned in class.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Analyze raw data using appropriate graphical and numerical procedures. Describe shape, outliers, center, and spread of datasets in the context of your research question. Include appropriate graphical displays and numeric summaries/descriptions in your final report. Show all applicable work, including sampling distribution, test statistic calculation, etc.
